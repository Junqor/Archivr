Group F for CSci 150 Fall 2024

# Project Description:
	
This idea is a website that serves a one-stop hub for tracking, rating, and discussing all forms of media. Many other types of media trackers focus on one type of media be it movies, shows, books, etc (e.g. letterboxd, serializd). This makes it so you have to juggle multiple different accounts, and limits your recommendations to only things from the same media type. Whether it's movies, TV shows, books, or music, this website would bring everything together in one place. It would allow you to share your thoughts, join discussions, and discover new favorites based on personalized recommendations.
