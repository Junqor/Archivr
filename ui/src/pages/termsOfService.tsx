      <p>
        Archivr&#8482; is an agency of the U.S. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. As an
        extension of the state we reserve full rights and responsibility to the
        use of the state's (our) justified monopoly on violence to the fullest
        extent possible. The following is not an agreement for you to consent
        to, but a fair warning as to what actions may/may not provoke our wrath.
        Any who violate these terms will be punished with a fee of $1000000000
        USD. Failure to comply with said fee is punishable by death. On the flip
        side, compliant users get free ice cream every sunday (ice cream
        sunday).
