      <p>
      Archivr™ is an agency of the U.S. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. As an extension of the state we reserve full rights and responsibility to the use of the state’s (our) justified monopoly on violence to the fullest extent possible. The following is not an agreement for you to consent to, but a fair warning as to what actions may/may not provoke our wrath. Any who violate these terms will be punished with a fee of $1000000000 USD. Failure to comply with said fee is punishable by death. On the flip side, compliant users get free ice cream every sunday (ice cream sunday).
